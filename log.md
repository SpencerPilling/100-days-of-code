# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned Git and GitHub to start this Journal. Read about Markup to edit readme files. Created a new repository and pushed completed Free code camp projects into it. Coded a quick under construction page for my website.

**Thoughts:** After putting this challenge off for so long, I am excited to finally sit down and do it! Im happy I am getting the hang of using git and look forward to updating my projects.

### Day 02: Aug 01, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started my Technical Doc Page Project. Im doing it on the SASS Compiler. I did the HTML markup for the page and some styling. I have the sidebar displayed and one heading and paragraph on the content side.

**Thoughts:** So, sitting down with a blank document kinda made my mind go blank for a few minutes. No one to parrot me through and It felt like I forgot everything. Im really glad that I started taking notes and was able to go back and read them. It helped get the mind working again and remember what the hell I was doing. I chose to try and do this page with CSS Grid since it was the last thing I learned. Im happy with my progress today and look forward tomorrow. Im also looking forward to going to bed at a decent time. :grin:

### Day 03: Aug 02, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the responsive issue Fleuron Gnadekpa(@FGnadekpa) found when looking at my projects on a mobile device. I never included a meta viewport in the head tag. So the layout were just staying the same on mobile and not acting to media query. I also changed the NavBar in my Tech Doc Page. I used flexbox inside of CSS grid to make it work the way I wanted. I then added some content to the main doc and styled it abit.

**Thoughts:** Im happy with what I have done so far on the Tech Doc Page. If I get stuck on something I either go back to my notes on the CSS course I took on udemy or I just search stackoverflow for a solution. Im sure this is how you learn right?

### Day 04: Aug 03, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Technical Doc Page. CSS Grid Box was not working for me so I switched content layout to flex box. Took a while to get everything looking the way I wanted. I also added some more content. 

**Thoughts:** Im still confused a bit by the whole CSS layout thing. I hope with practice that I will start to get the hang of it.

### Day 05: Aug 04, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally Finished the Technical Document Page!! YAY. I added all the content. Made the links in the navbar nice looking. Made the page responsive using media query's. Then I added a bit of styling to make it all look nice.

**Thoughts:** I feel so damn slow! everything takes me forever to figure out, especially with those media query's. Just getting all the breakpoints to work out the way I wanted them to. Im still a little shaky with the whole flexbox layout stuff.
