# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned Git and GitHub to start this Journal. Read about Markup to edit readme files. Created a new repository and pushed completed Free code camp projects into it. Coded a quick under construction page for my website.

**Thoughts:** After putting this challenge off for so long, I am excited to finally sit down and do it! Im happy I am getting the hang of using git and look forward to updating my projects.

### Day 02: Aug 01, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started my Technical Doc Page Project. Im doing it on the SASS Compiler. I did the HTML markup for the page and some styling. I have the sidebar displayed and one heading and paragraph on the content side.

**Thoughts:** So, sitting down with a blank document kinda made my mind go blank for a few minutes. No one to parrot me through and It felt like I forgot everything. Im really glad that I started taking notes and was able to go back and read them. It helped get the mind working again and remember what the hell I was doing. I chose to try and do this page with CSS Grid since it was the last thing I learned. Im happy with my progress today and look forward tomorrow. Im also looking forward to going to bed at a decent time. :grin:
