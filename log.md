**Today's Progress**: Sec 7 of JS Course. ES6. Learned about let and const, block scope and new way to write IIFE's. Also learned about template literals when using strings. Then we covered the basics of Arrow functions.

### Day 03: Oct 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Sec 7 of JS Course. ES6. Im really digging ES6. Arrow functions are clean. Deconstructing Arrays is very handy. Using .find and .findIndex is awesome. The Spread operator (...), my gosh!. Rest Parameters, Whoot Whoot!. Default Parameters! Yes please!. Next up is Maps and Classes. Cant wait!

**Thoughts:** I have been really into learning all these new tools in ES6 to keep code more efficient and cleaner looking. Cant get enough of it.

### Day 05: Oct 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got home from a unexpected work day. I felt to tired to dive into the coding challenge so instead I did some sections on @freeCodeCamp. Knocked off 13 lessons on the ES6 Section of the JavaScript Certification. Also got to add some more things to my ES6 notes.  

**Thoughts:** Got up late. Felt Tired. Tired after work. Not the greatest day but at least I snuck in some coding.

### Day 06: Oct 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Coding Challenge, Display results for a City Report that includes Parks and Streets. At first, like always,I stared at the screen trying to figure where to start. I made a class for names and build years, then sub classes for the data of streets and parks. A lot of going back to my notes and also searching on the web. Hope to finish after work.

**Thoughts:** I love these coding challenges, they really get the brain moving! lol.
