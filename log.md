### Day 03: Oct 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Sec 7 of JS Course. ES6. Im really digging ES6. Arrow functions are clean. Deconstructing Arrays is very handy. Using .find and .findIndex is awesome. The Spread operator (...), my gosh!. Rest Parameters, Whoot Whoot!. Default Parameters! Yes please!. Next up is Maps and Classes. Cant wait!

**Thoughts:** I have been really into learning all these new tools in ES6 to keep code more efficient and cleaner looking. Cant get enough of it.

### Day 05: Oct 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got home from a unexpected work day. I felt to tired to dive into the coding challenge so instead I did some sections on @freeCodeCamp. Knocked off 13 lessons on the ES6 Section of the JavaScript Certification. Also got to add some more things to my ES6 notes.  

**Thoughts:** Got up late. Felt Tired. Tired after work. Not the greatest day but at least I snuck in some coding.

### Day 06: Oct 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Coding Challenge, Display results for a City Report that includes Parks and Streets. At first, like always,I stared at the screen trying to figure where to start. I made a class for names and build years, then sub classes for the data of streets and parks. A lot of going back to my notes and also searching on the web. Hope to finish after work.

**Thoughts:** I love these coding challenges, they really get the brain moving! lol.

### Day 07: Oct 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Coding Challenge, Finished the coding challenge this morning. My code is no where near as nice as the solution but it got the job done. I feel that I need to build a project using all this JavaScript I have been learning, Before I move on and pack my brain full of more information.

**Thoughts:** Im thinking of making an app for work to keep track of our product leaving the gravel pit. Right now we are just keeping everything in a log book and taking pictures. I think trying to build an app that I could use from the phone to store this data then print it would be helpful.

### Day 08: Oct 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started the html part of this gravel pit, load count, project I am going to do. Built the form with some value selectors and radio buttons. I will dive into some CSS tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** Nothing big today, but it sure felt good to sit down, laptop in hand, and do some coding for myself. I think this is going to be a good learning experience and I am looking forward to it.

### Day 09: Nov 01, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Wrote some CSS to style my HTML form for the gravel pit project. I was surprised that I could remember how to use CSS still. Still have to style the inputs and button then I can move into the real fun of making it work!

**Thoughts:** I don't know why I doubt myself. When I was writing code everything came back to me regarding CSS.

### Day 10: Nov 05, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added the Date and Job name input fields to my gravel pit project. I added some style to the input fields and selectors. Then I looked at my page on mobile, Firefox and Safari have their own default style for these selectors. So I went down a rabbit hole trying to figure out how to override these styles.  

**Thoughts:** Lots of research, little codding. lol.
