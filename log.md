### Day 01: Oct 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Sec 6 of JS Course. Felt great to finally complete this project. Next up is is learning ES6. Once I complete this next section I am going to go back and complete the ES6 Section of Freecodecamp. 

**Thoughts:** This is a great start to my second attempt at the #100DaysOfCode challenge!

### Day 02: Oct 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Sec 7 of JS Course. ES6. Learned about let and const, block scope and new way to way to write IIFE's. Also learned about template literals when using strings. Then we covered the basics of Arrow functions.

**Thoughts:** ES6 so far is so cool! I love adapting new ways to write more cleaner and efficient code.
