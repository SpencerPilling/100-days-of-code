### Day 03: Oct 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Sec 7 of JS Course. ES6. Im really digging ES6. Arrow functions are clean. Deconstructing Arrays is very handy. Using .find and .findIndex is awesome. The Spread operator (...), my gosh!. Rest Parameters, Whoot Whoot!. Default Parameters! Yes please!. Next up is Maps and Classes. Cant wait!

**Thoughts:** I have been really into learning all these new tools in ES6 to keep code more efficient and cleaner looking. Cant get enough of it.
