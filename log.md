### Day 01: Oct 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Sec 6 of JS Course. Felt great to finally complete this project. Next up is is learning ES6. Once I complete this next section I am going to go back and complete the ES6 Section of Freecodecamp. 

**Thoughts:** This is a great start to my second attempt at the #100DaysOfCode challenge!
