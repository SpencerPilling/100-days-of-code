# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned Git and GitHub to start this Journal. Read about Markup to edit readme files. Created a new repository and pushed completed Free code camp projects into it. Coded a quick under construction page for my website.

**Thoughts:** After putting this challenge off for so long, I am excited to finally sit down and do it! Im happy I am getting the hang of using git and look forward to updating my projects.
